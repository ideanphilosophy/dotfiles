# Dotfiles
Dotfiles for many window managers, configs, etc.

This will be licensed under MIT, feel free to configure or change anything that may need changing. I will most likely have a readme bunched in with these dotfiles so be sure to look through said dotfiles incase a config needs a status such as Polybar or any patches I may apply to a program.

If you have questions feel free to email me at thedoctorwithoutphd@outlook.com
